This repository contains the remains of a project originally developed for a client but ultimately canceled before completion. Due to contractual and confidentiality reasons, it has been stripped of identifying details, leaving only a skeleton of its original structure.

- SQL database operations in a backend application  
- **Node.js** improvement & **Express.js** routes  
- **EJS** (Embedded JavaScript Templates) for rendering dynamic pages  
- General **JavaScript** & backend and frontedn development principles
